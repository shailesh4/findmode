# findmode
This program will take a list of numbers in a text file and give you the mode for that list.



I made this program today while doing a project for Computer Architecture where I needed to find a mode of a color component of a given .bmp file.
There were 40,000 lines of numbers

I was trying to find something online to just upload my file and check if my assembly program works correctly. 

Since I couldn't find it I made it and putting it here. It's a pretty easy program.
